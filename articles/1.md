# File Browser in Dashboard

https://flows.nodered.org/flow/44bc7ad491aacb4253dd8a5f757b5407

I wanted an easier way to access my files on my PI and created this File Browser in dashboard. Main features:

- Show files in local folders: size, dates
- Download files
- Navigate to any folder
- Delete files
- Show/Hide hidden files
- Open CSV files on a Graph

Check the comment node on the top which explains how to set up the flow.
